# Description
Lost&Found is a mobile application for Android devices designed to simplify the reporting of lost and found items, especially useful in confined geographic areas such as university campuses.
Thanks to an intuitive interface, users can quickly and in real time register lost or found items, facilitating direct communication between the two parties involved.
Each report includes the name, a detailed description, an image, and the exact location where the item was lost or found. Users can then select specific categories from a predefined list, making it easier to identify items, and provide a phone number to be contacted.
